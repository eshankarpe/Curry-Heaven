# Curry Heaven
## By 10-year-old chef Eshan

## How I started My Cooking Journey?
When I was 9 years old I started watching the cooking channel America's Test Kitchen and others, when I saw the final dish I wanted to try those dishes. Later I began to watch the YouTube channel Mark Wiens, he is a food person who loves to eat different kinds of food from all over the world. Whenever I see his videos about the food I get fascinated about the colorful food and different techniques and textures and that makes my mouth water.

My mom has a love and passion for cooking and I have seen my mom trying out new dishes and then I started slowly helping her in easy things like stirring the curry, garnishing the food, and more. Then this summer during the lockdown I wanted to try something new with my mom that involves cooking, under my mom's guidance I decided to learn how to cook pancakes. When I tried to cook the pancake for the first time I had some difficulties like pouring the batter into the pan, adjusting the temperature, and flipping the pancake. It took me a few days to get the hang of it, but soon I was able to make pancakes all by myself without any help.

Then later on I started learning how to make dosas, sandwiches, and omelets. That is how I got my interest in cooking. I am still learning to make new dishes like Indian dishes on the weekends. I am looking forward to making Thai, Chinese, Italian food, and different kinds of food.
